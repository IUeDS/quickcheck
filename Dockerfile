# --- Runtime Entrypoint for Writable Volumes ---

# This `entrypoint.sh` script will run at container startup and set correct permissions
# for the `www-data` user on the *mounted* volume.

# Include and use the entrypoint script.
# NOTE: we will begin running the entrypoint script as root, but it will switch to the `www-data` user
# before starting the Apache service. This is a common pattern to ensure that the web server has
# the necessary permissions to write to the storage directory while still running with minimal privileges.

# The setup script will run *before* apache.
# NO CUSTOM ENTRYPOINT HERE. Let the base image manage it.
# The`setup.sh` will be executed by the default `docker-php-entrypoint`
# before `apache2-foreground` is run.

# CMD is the setup script followed by the original Apache command
